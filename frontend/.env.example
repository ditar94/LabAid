# LabAid Frontend — Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in values as needed.
# All Vite env vars must be prefixed with VITE_.

# API base URL — defaults to "/api" (works with Vite proxy in dev and Nginx in prod).
# Override when the frontend talks directly to a different backend URL (e.g. Cloud Run).
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
